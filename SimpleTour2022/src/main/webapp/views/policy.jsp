            <h3>Simple Tour</h3>
            <h2>AGREEMENT BETWEEN USER AND SIMPLETOUR N.V.</h2>
            <h3>1. General</h3>
            <p>
              Welcome to the SimpleTour.com website (the "Website"). The terms "we", "us", "our", “SimpleTour” and "SimpleTour N.V." refer
              to SimpleTour N.V. having its offices at Kesselstraße 5-7, 40221 Düsseldorf, Germany, a public company with limited
              liability (<i>naamloze vennootschap</i>) incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and registered with the
              trade register of the Chamber of Commerce in Amsterdam under registration number 67222927. Access to our Website,
              any SimpleTour mobile or tablet application, or any other feature or other SimpleTour platform (collectively the
              "Platform") is offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance without modification of all the terms, conditions,
              and notices set forth below (collectively, the "Terms"). We recommend that you print a copy of these Terms for
              future reference. Please read these Terms carefully, as they contain important information about limitations of
              liability and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than in court. You should also read our Privacy
              Policy, which also governs your use of our Platform and sets out the terms on which we may process any personal
              information that we collect about you, or that you provide to us, and is incorporated by reference into these Terms.
              The Privacy Policy can be found here. By accessing or using our
              Platform, you acknowledge and agree to have read, understood, and agreed to be legally bound by these Terms and our
              Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use or access our Platform or contact our support
              center here.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Changes to the Terms</h3>
            <p>
              We may amend these Terms from time to time to comply with any regulatory requirements or if there are changes to our
              business practices. Every time you wish to use our Platform, please check these Terms to ensure you understand the
              terms that apply at the time. Your use of our Platform will be subject to the most recent version of the Terms
              available on the Platform. We recommend that you read through the Terms available on the Platform regularly so that
              you can be sure that you are aware of any changes that may apply to you.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Access and Use of the Platform</h3>
            <p>
              The Platform is currently made available to you for your personal, non-commercial use, free of charge.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not guarantee that access to the Platform, or any content on it, will always be available or be uninterrupted.
              We may suspend, withdraw, discontinue or change all or any part of the Platform without notice to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              You must not misuse the Platform by knowingly introducing viruses, trojans, worms, logic bombs or any other material
              which is malicious or technologically harmful. You must not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Platform, the
              server on which the Platform is stored or any server, computer or database connected to the Platform. You must not
              attack the Platform via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed denial-of service attack. We will report any
              such breach to the relevant law enforcement authorities and we will co-operate with those authorities by disclosing
              your identity to them. In the event of such a breach, your right to use the Platform will cease immediately.
            </p>
            <h3>4. We do not sell Hotel Products or other Travel Products</h3>
            <p>
              The Platform is a hotel search engine that provides users with comparisons for different offers for hotel rooms.
              SimpleTour does not provide, own or control any of the hotel services and products that you can access through our
              Platform (the “Hotel Products”). The Hotel Products are owned, controlled or made available by third parties (the
              “Hotel Providers”), either directly (e.g., a hotel) or through a facilitator of hotel reservations (e.g., an online
              travel company). The Hotel Providers are responsible for the Hotel Products and for all booking contracts, including for
              example SimpleTour Express Bookings. The booking of a Hotel Product will solely be made with the Hotel Provider. The Hotel Provider’s terms and privacy policies apply to your booking, so you must agree to, and
              understand those terms. Further, the terms of the hotel where you plan to stay, if different from the Hotel
              Provider, will also apply to your booking, so you must also agree to, and understand those terms. Your interaction
              with any Hotel Provider accessed through our Platform is at your own risk, and SimpleTour does not have any
              responsibility should anything go wrong with your booking. SimpleTour has no control over the Hotel Products or Hotel
              Providers. For more information about how SimpleTour works, we recommend that you read our FAQs, which can be found ections/360000014707-How-SimpleTour-Works">here and are incorporated by
              reference into these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              SimpleTour may also display offers for travel destination products such as, e.g., tours, events, attractions, cruises
              and others. SimpleTour does not provide, own or control any of the destination travel products that you can access
              through our Platform (the “Travel Products”). The Travel Products are owned, controlled or made available by third
              parties (the “Travel Product Provider”), either directly (e.g., a tour operator) or through a facilitator (e.g., an
              online travel company). The Travel Product Providers are responsible for the Travel Products and all booking
              contracts. The Travel Product Provider’s terms and privacy policies apply to your booking, so you must agree to, and
              understand those terms. Further, the terms of the individual operator of the Travel Product which you plan to use,
              if different from the Travel Product Provider, will also apply to your booking, so you must also agree to, and
              understand those terms.
            </p>
            <p>Your interaction with any Hotel Provider or Travel Product Provider accessed through our Platform is at your own
              risk, and SimpleTour does not have any responsibility should anything go wrong with your booking. SimpleTour has no
              control over the Hotel Products and Travel Products (together “the Products”) or Hotel Providers and Travel Product
              Providers (together “the Providers”). For more information about how SimpleTour works, we recommend that you read our
              FAQs, which can be found here and are incorporated by reference into these Terms.</p>
            <p>
              SimpleTour hosts content, including prices, images and other information, made available by or obtained from
              Providers (“Provider Content”), as well as content provided by users, such as comments, ratings and other
              information (“User Content” and together with the Provider Content, the “Content”). SimpleTour is in no way responsible
              or liable for the accuracy, quality, completeness, reliability, timeliness or trustworthiness of the Content, and
              SimpleTour has no influence over the Content. In particular, we do not guarantee that Provider Content, in particular
              the prices reflected therein, will be updated in real time or that a particular Product will be available. As
              a result, the price displayed by a Provider may not correspond to that displayed on our Platform.Ratings displayed
              on this Platform are intended as only general guidelines, and we do not guarantee the accuracy of
              the ratings or of any User Content.
            </p>
            <h3>5. SimpleTour Express Booking and SimpleTour Book &amp; Go</h3>
            <p>
              The “SimpleTour Express Booking” and SimpleTour Book &amp; Go services facilitate the booking of a Hotel Product with a Hotel
              Provider through our Platform. We may make SimpleTour Express Booking and/or SimpleTour Book &amp; Go available in our
              discretion from time to time. If you opt to use SimpleTour Express Booking or SimpleTour Book &amp; Go (where available), the
              booking will be made with the Hotel Provider named on the booking page respectively the checkout page, and SimpleTour
              will forward the booking information that you provide to the relevant Hotel Provider. When you make a booking
              through SimpleTour Express Booking or SimpleTour Book &amp; Go, our Platform acts as only a user interface, and you will only
              have a valid booking with a Hotel Provider if you receive written confirmation within two days from that Hotel
              Provider accepting your booking. The contract for the relevant booking will be made between you and the Hotel
              Provider. SimpleTour will indicate the Hotel Provider, who is the actual merchant of record, e.g. on the checkout page,
              the booking website or in the terms and conditions for the booking. SimpleTour has no responsibility for the booking or
              the Hotel Product because SimpleTour neither creates the description of the Hotel Product, defines the price and any
              fees, confirms any booking nor provides the Hotel Products that you book. If you have any issues or disputes around
              your booking and/or the Hotel Product, you agree to address and resolve these with the Hotel Provider .

              The Providers are independent from SimpleTour and are not agents or employees of SimpleTour. SimpleTour is not liable
              for the acts, errors, omissions, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any Provider,
              including for injuries, death, property damage, or other damages or expenses resulting therefrom. SimpleTour will not
              be liable for any cancellation, overbooking, strike, force majeure or other causes beyond its direct control.
              SimpleTour does not accept responsibility for the uninterrupted accessibility to our Platform and may carry out
              technical or maintenance work on the Platform at any of its choosing.
            </p>
            <p>
              In no event shall SimpleTour be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special or consequential damages
              arising out of, or in any way connected with, your access to, display of or use of this Platform or with the delay
              or inability to access, display or use this Platform (including, but not limited to, your reliance upon opinions
              appearing on this Platform; any computer viruses, information, software, linked sites, products and services
              obtaining through this Platform; or otherwise arising out of the access to, display of or use of this Platform)
              whether based on a theory of negligence, contract, tort, strict liability, consumer protection statutes, or

              The limitation of liability reflects the allocation of risk between the parties. The limitations specified in this

              essential purpose. The limitations of liability provided in these Terms survive the termination of your relationship
              with SimpleTour.

            <h3>14. You agree to protect us</h3>
            <p>
              You agree to defend and indemnify SimpleTour and any of its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against
              any claims, causes of action, demands, recoveries, losses, damages, fines, penalties or other costs or expenses of
              any kind or nature including but not limited to reasonable legal and accounting fees, brought by third parties as a
              result of:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                your breach of these Terms or the documents referenced herein;
              </li>
              <li>
                your violation of any law or the rights of a third party; or
              </li>
              <li>
                your use of our Platform.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>15. Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>
              SimpleTour is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve your
              concerns. But if we are unsuccessful, you may pursue claims as explained in this section.
            </p>
            <p>
              You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims relating in any way to the Platform, any
              dealings with our customer service agents, any services or products provided, any representations made by us, or our
              Privacy Policy (“Claims”) by contacting SimpleTour’s customer support center here. If we are not able to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you
              may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except you may assert Claims on an
              individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. This includes any Claims you assert against us and our
              subsidiaries. This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms, regardless of whether prior
              versions of the Terms required arbitration.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an
              arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages,
              attorneys’ fees and costs), and must follow and enforce these Terms as a court would.
            </p>
            <p>
              Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA
              Consumer Arbitration Rules and specifically Consumer Arbitration Rule R-14, which gives the arbitrator the power to
              rule on all issues concerning the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Payment of all filing, administration
              and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, except as provided in this section. If your total Claims
              seek less than {10},000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator’s fees. You
              may choose to have an arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions or in person in the state
              where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
            </p>
            <p>
              To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims to
              “SimpleTour Legal,” at SimpleTour N.V. Kesselstraße 5-7, 40221 Düsseldorf, Germany. If we request arbitration against you,
              we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided. The AAA's rules and filing
              instructions are available at by calling 1-800-778-7879.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class,
              consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we
              each waive any right to a jury trial. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms.
              An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <h3>16. Complaints or Queries</h3>

            <h3>17. General</h3>
            <p>
              These Terms and any non-contractual obligations arising out of them are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act,
              federal arbitration law, and for searches or bookings made by U.S. residents, the laws of the state in which you
              reside, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Use of our Platform is unauthorized in any jurisdiction
              that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this paragraph.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our performance of these Terms is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms
              limits our right to comply with law enforcement or other governmental or legal requests or requirements relating to
              your use of our Platform or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use.
            </p>
            <p>
              These Terms do not create or infer any rights that are enforceable by any person who is not a party to them.
            </p>
            <p>
              If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and
              enforceability of the remaining provisions will not in any way be affected or impaired. Our failure or delay in
              enforcing any provision of these Terms at any time does not waive our right to enforce the same or any other
              provision(s) hereof in the future.
